##About##
__koGrid__ is a direct knockout port of [ng-grid](http://angular-ui.github.com/ng-grid/) which was originally inspired by koGrid, which was inspired by SlickGrid. I know, right?

koGrid is in 2.1.1 release currently.

_The sizzle_:

```html
<div data-bind="koGrid: { data: myObservableArray }"></div>
```
```javascript
var vm = {
  myObservableArray: ko.observableArray(/* array of any complex obects */)
};

ko.applyBindings(vm);
```
